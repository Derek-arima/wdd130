        Hey y'all! my name is Derek and I am majoring in software engineering. I was born in Hawaii but my family now lives in
        Las Vegas, Nevada. I served a mission in Tampa, Florida. In my free time I play competitive pickleball and I hope to one
        day become a pro pickleball player. I also enjoy going contry dancing and riding my motorcycle when the weather is not too bad.
        I am taking this class because I would like to familiarize myself with html and css so I can start to develop a front end for
        some of the projects that I would like to start.
